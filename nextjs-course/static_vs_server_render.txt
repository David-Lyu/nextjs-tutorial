static generation generates the code during build process (npm run build)
  - function called getStaticProps() {} prepare props for the page
    - has to be in the pages folder
    - problem:
      - data could be out dated. Need to run npm run build
        -fix:
          - to fix this problem there is a property revalidate which takes a number in seconds to re fetch data
          - can rebuild if there are not many changes every time

  - can be async so can use async await

  - is not executed on the client side since it is ran once on the build process
    - so can reach a database etc...


server side generation will always run in the server
  - function called getServerSideProps {}
    - has to be in the pages folder
  - wait for html to be generated on every requests

tldr
  - static generation is great if you don't need to get a request every second
    etc or need access to context.req

  - server side generation is great if the data changes multiple times every second
